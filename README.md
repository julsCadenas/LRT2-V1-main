## A LRT2 fare calculator

The fare prices are calculated in Philippine Peso.
This is a pretty simple java program that I made for practice purposes.

the source code is found in the src folder.

LRT-2 had a fare increase starting AUGUST 2, 2023, you can find the updated and an easier to update version in the src2 folder

This is run within your IDE
